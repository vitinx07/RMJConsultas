If you are new to the API, read more about how the api works.

Send a transactional email using a basic HTML content
Let's assume we would like to send the following basic email.

HTML content	<html><head></head><body><p>Hello,</p>This is my first transactional email sent from Brevo.</p></body></html>
Email subject	"Hello worldl"
Sender name	"Sender Alex"
Sender email	"email":"senderalex@example.com"
Recipient name	"John Doe"
Recipient email	"email":"johndoe@example.com"
The HTTP request to send using cURL is the following:

cURL

curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'api-key:YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{  
   "sender":{  
      "name":"Sender Alex",
      "email":"senderalex@example.com"
   },
   "to":[  
      {  
         "email":"testmail@example.com",
         "name":"John Doe"
      }
   ],
   "subject":"Hello world",
   "htmlContent":"<html><head></head><body><p>Hello,</p>This is my first transactional email sent from Brevo.</p></body></html>"
}'
Send a transactional email containing dynamic contact attributes and transactional parameters
In this tutorial, we'll be sending an order confirmation email to a contact, where we'll insert dynamic contact attributes (contact name, address) and transactional parameters (order number, expected date of delivery).

For the sake of simplicity, we'll use an existing email template to design our email.

This is the email you should get by the end of the tutorial:
