# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed:

1. **Container Image Push Failure** - Applied all suggested fixes:
   - ✅ Project size verified (516MB - well under 8GB limit)
   - ✅ Added Dockerfile with optimizations for Replit Deployments
   - ✅ Created .dockerignore to reduce build context
   - ✅ Added environment variable NPM_CONFIG_CACHE to disable package caching
   - ✅ Added health check endpoint at `/api/health`
   - ✅ All required secrets configured (DATABASE_URL, BREVO_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, JWT_SECRET)

2. **Frontend Logo Error** - Fixed ReferenceError:
   - ✅ Removed missing logoPath import from home.tsx
   - ✅ Replaced with placeholder comment
   - ✅ Verified no other references exist in codebase

## Deployment Optimizations:

- **Multi-stage Docker build** with Node.js Alpine for smaller image size
- **Security hardening** with non-root user
- **Health check monitoring** for container health
- **Environment variable configuration** for production deployment
- **Proper secret management** through Replit Secrets

## Next Steps:

1. Retry the deployment (should resolve the temporary infrastructure issue)
2. All deployment requirements are now satisfied
3. Application ready for production deployment on Replit

## Health Check:
- Endpoint: `/api/health`
- Status: Active and responding correctly
- Response: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-07-21T11:44:53.938Z"}`
